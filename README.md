# WordleSolver
This is a project based on the game Wordle, which is a guessing game.
The way it works is that it suggests you a word to start off with and then you input it in to the Wordle game. You then put in the results of the wordle game in to program and it will suggest you with another word.

It is done in python with guidance from a couple of content creators such as 3 Blue 1 Brown and the Dodgy Engineer.
